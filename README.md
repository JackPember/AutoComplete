# AutoComplete
auto completion project for data structures II. Utilizes multiple classes and methods in order to return terms based on a prefix string a user types in, with each term having an associated weight, with the higher weight values appearing first.
Put all the .txt files into a seperate folder. 
Put all the .java files in a src folder.
Put both of those folders into a project folder.
Import the files as a java project.
Run the AutocompleteGUI class to test out the code.
The AutocompleteGUI was not written by me, credit goes to Princeton University for that code, it was simply used as a way to test the term, autocomplete, and binarysearchdeluxe .java files.
